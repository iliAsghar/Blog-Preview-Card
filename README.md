## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

this project was an excellent design and i had fun designing it .

i didn't run into much problems, however, something that i learned throughout this project was how to stop a flex item from stretching to full flex

```css
.card__content {
  ...
  align-items: start;
  ...
}
```

i also tried to use the BEM naming as much as possible .
### Continued devwelopment

for future projects , i hope to get better at naming my classes and ids and get used to BEM naming.
